 Block Memory Generator data initialization complete.
Block Memory Generator module testbench.My_top.My_INST_MEMORY.IROM.inst.native_mem_module.blk_mem_gen_v8_4_4_inst is using a behavioral model for simulation which will not precisely model memory collision behavior.
WARNING: This core is supplied with a behavioral model. To model cycle-accurate behavior you must run timing simulation.
